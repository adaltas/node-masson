# RNGD

Install RNGD Service to avoid beeing out of entropy by replacing /dev/urandom by /dev/random device.

RNGD, or Random Number Generator Daemon, is a vital tool within Unix-like systems, enhancing cryptographic security by bolstering the generation of truly random numbers. This utility ensures heightened system security by monitoring hardware random number generators (HRNGs), harnessing their raw, unpredictable data. By incorporating this randomness into the system's pool of numbers, rngd fortifies cryptographic operations, ensuring robust security measures for sensitive data and critical system functions."
